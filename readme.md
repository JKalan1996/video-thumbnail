## Installation

Installing dependencies can be a really painful experience, painful enough to scare you away.

You should install the following packages:

+ Python 3 (of course)
+ Pillow (PIL)
+ ffmpeg
+ PyAV

If you have managed to install all above, congratulations! Enjoy~!


## Usage

The only thing that is currently very much needed to configure is the font. You should carefully choose a truetype font,
something like `*.ttf` and put it in the '\font' directory, specify the font name in `thumbnail.py`. Done!

The thumbnail jpg file should be saved to your video path.
